# Downloads-Folder-Cleaner

Downloads Folder Cleaner is a Python-based application that allows users to delete files inside their Downloads folder that meet specific extension requirements. The user can configure the extension requirements by editing a file named "ext_config.txt", which allows them to specify extensions such as ".pdf" or ".txt".

The application uses the "os" package to interact with the user's file system and delete files that match the specified extensions. Additionally, the application creates a file named "logs.txt" that keeps a record of all the deleted files. This log file can be useful for users who want to keep track of which files were deleted.

By using this application, users can easily clean up their Downloads folder, remove unwanted files, and keep a record of the deleted files for future reference.
